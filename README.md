# Hello-World

My name is Jordan and I am looking to expand my knowledge and attempt to enter the field of Software Development. I have a bachelor's in Computer Science and have been working in the Information Technology field for 2 and half years.

I currently do not primarily develop but have been creating small tools for co-workers in order to troubleshoot and solve issues that come up during our jobs assisting users in our business.
